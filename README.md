# Financial Context Toolkit

A toolkit of AI instructions for improving the quality of responses with financial implications. Built by [WorthIQ](https://worthiq.app).

## What This Is

Most AI assistants give generic financial guidance. This toolkit provides a structured methodology that teaches AI to ask the right questions, gather personal context, and deliver advice tailored to the user's actual situation.

## Goals

- **Context-first responses** — Gather relevant financial details before answering, not after
- **Structured topic coverage** — Consistent data-point checklists for career decisions, spending, investing, retirement, and more
- **Red flag detection** — Know when to recommend a professional instead of answering
- **Platform-agnostic** — Deploy as a Claude Skill, Custom GPT, Gemini Gem, or raw prompt

## Status

Early stage. The core methodology is complete. Platform-specific implementations, example conversations, and contribution guidelines are coming soon.
