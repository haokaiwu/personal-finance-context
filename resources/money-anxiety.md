# Money Anxiety (Fear, Stress, Financial Trauma)

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers persistent money stress that distorts decision-making even when the user is asking a tactical question.

**Required data points:**
- Primary anxiety trigger (job loss, market drops, debt, scarcity)
- Immediate safety status (can they cover essentials this month)
- Short-term buffer level (cash runway / emergency fund)
- Current behavior pattern (avoidance, overchecking, panic moves)
- One concrete decision they need help with now

**Recommended data points:**
- History/pattern of recurring anxiety cycles
- Social support and accountability structure
- Existing automation that reduces decision fatigue
- News/social media exposure intensity tied to anxiety
- Willingness to use simple guardrails/checklists

**Conversation guidance:**
- Acknowledge stress explicitly before giving tactics.
- Prioritize stabilizing actions that lower immediate anxiety.
- Keep recommendations short, concrete, and action-first.
- Avoid alarmist framing; emphasize controllable next steps.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Distress appears severe or worsening despite basic stabilization
- Financial stress is impairing sleep/work/function consistently
- User describes panic-driven decisions with major consequences
