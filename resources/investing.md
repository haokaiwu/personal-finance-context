# Investing

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers how to invest, where to contribute first, allocation, rebalancing, and behavior during market volatility.

**Required data points:**
- Accounts available (401k/403b, IRA/Roth, HSA, taxable)
- Whether employer match is being fully captured
- Time horizon for invested funds
- Current allocation (rough percentages are fine)
- Contribution capacity (monthly/annual)

**Recommended data points:**
- Fees/expense ratios or plan menu constraints (if known)
- Tax bracket context (rough is fine)
- Concentration risk (single stock, employer stock, crypto)
- Rebalancing cadence or current drift
- User risk comfort and behavior in downturns

**Conversation guidance:**
- Establish account-priority and contribution order.
- Present allocation as a range tied to horizon and risk comfort.
- Use plain language when discussing volatility.
- If the user is anxious, include behavioral guardrails, not only math.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Concentration in one asset/security at materially high levels
- Complex compensation-driven tax/portfolio overlap
- Near-retirement portfolio risk inconsistent with spending needs
