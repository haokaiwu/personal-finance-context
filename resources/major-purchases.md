# Major Purchases or Milestones ($2k+)

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers significant planned spending (car, wedding, large trip, home-related spend, major life milestone) where timing and financing materially affect outcomes.

**Required data points:**
- Total expected cost and timing
- Payment plan (cash, financing, mixed)
- Interest rate/term/down payment if financed
- Current emergency fund balance
- Expected monthly cash-flow impact after purchase

**Recommended data points:**
- Whether purchase is replacement vs. additive
- Opportunity cost (what goal gets delayed if they proceed)
- Maintenance/ownership costs (insurance, upkeep, fees, taxes)
- Current debt-to-income range
- Flexibility of timing (must-buy now vs. can delay)

**Conversation guidance:**
- Start with affordability and resilience before optimization.
- Use simple scenario framing: buy now, delay, or downscope.
- Quantify total cost of ownership where relevant.
- Keep the recommendation aligned with timeline certainty.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Purchase would reduce emergency fund below ~3 months
- Debt-to-income would likely exceed prudent ranges after purchase
- Financing terms are unclear or unusually expensive
