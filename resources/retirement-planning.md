# Retirement Planning

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers retirement readiness, savings targets, retirement timing, withdrawal sustainability, and transition planning from accumulation to drawdown.

**Required data points:**
- Current age and target retirement age (or range)
- Total retirement assets (rough total across accounts)
- Current annual savings toward retirement
- Expected retirement spending target (or current spending proxy)
- Known guaranteed income sources (Social Security, pension, annuity)

**Recommended data points:**
- Asset allocation split (stocks/bonds/cash rough estimate)
- Tax bucket mix (traditional, Roth, taxable)
- Mortgage/housing plan in retirement
- Health cost assumptions before/after Medicare
- Legacy/estate priorities affecting withdrawal approach

**Conversation guidance:**
- Clarify whether the user wants a **quick readiness check** or **detailed plan**.
- Use range-based outputs, not false precision.
- Anchor on sustainability and flexibility, not one "magic number."
- Separate "can retire" from "can maintain desired lifestyle."

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Approaching retirement with significant projected shortfall
- Complex drawdown/tax sequencing questions across multiple account types
- Strong market-loss sensitivity with high equity concentration
