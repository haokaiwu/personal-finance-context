# Getting Started with Investing

> This is a scenario file that builds on the [Investing overview](investing-overview.md). See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This scenario covers first-time investors figuring out where to open accounts, how to prioritize contributions, and what to invest in when starting from zero investing experience.

**Required data points:**
- Whether employer offers a retirement plan (401k/403b) and match details
- Monthly amount available to invest
- Existing debts and interest rates (to determine invest-vs-pay-down priority)
- Emergency fund status (investing before a buffer is established changes the advice)
- Time horizon and purpose of invested money (retirement, medium-term goal, general growth)

**Recommended data points:**
- Tax filing status and rough income bracket
- Comfort level with seeing account value drop temporarily
- Whether the user has opened any investment accounts yet
- Access to HSA through employer
- Interest in hands-off vs. hands-on approach

**Conversation guidance:**
- Start with the contribution priority ladder: employer match → high-interest debt → emergency fund → IRA/Roth → taxable.
- Recommend the simplest viable approach first (target-date fund or 2-3 fund portfolio) before discussing optimization.
- Normalize that starting is more important than optimizing — imperfect action beats perfect planning.
- Address the "what if I lose money" concern directly with time-horizon framing.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- High-interest debt (>8%) that should be prioritized over investing
- User wants to invest money they'll need within 1-2 years in equities
- Pressure from others to invest in speculative assets without understanding risk
