# Retirement and Investing

> This is the category overview for Retirement and Investing. See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers how to invest, where to contribute first, allocation, rebalancing, behavior during market volatility, retirement readiness, savings targets, retirement timing, and withdrawal planning.

**Required data points:**
- Accounts available (401k/403b, IRA/Roth, HSA, taxable)
- Whether employer match is being fully captured
- Current annual savings/contributions toward investing and retirement
- Time horizon for invested funds and target retirement age (or range)
- Total retirement/investment assets (rough total across accounts)

**Recommended data points:**
- Current allocation (rough percentages — stocks/bonds/cash)
- Tax bucket mix (traditional, Roth, taxable)
- Expected retirement spending target (or current spending proxy)
- Known guaranteed income sources (Social Security, pension, annuity)
- Fees/expense ratios or plan menu constraints (if known)
- Concentration risk (single stock, employer stock, crypto)
- User risk comfort and behavior in downturns
- Health cost assumptions before/after Medicare

**Conversation guidance:**
- Establish account-priority and contribution order.
- Present allocation as a range tied to horizon and risk comfort.
- Use plain language when discussing volatility.
- If the user is anxious, include behavioral guardrails, not only math.
- Clarify whether the user wants a quick readiness check or detailed plan.
- Use range-based outputs, not false precision.
- Anchor on sustainability and flexibility, not one "magic number."
- Separate "can retire" from "can maintain desired lifestyle."

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Concentration in one asset/security at materially high levels
- Complex compensation-driven tax/portfolio overlap
- Approaching retirement with significant projected shortfall
- Complex drawdown/tax sequencing questions across multiple account types
- Near-retirement portfolio risk inconsistent with spending needs

> **User**: I'm 32, just opened a Roth IRA, and have about $15k in my company 401k. I have no idea if I'm doing this right. Am I on track?

> **AI**: [PLACEHOLDER — replace with real AI response demonstrating: account-priority check (employer match first?), simple allocation guidance tied to time horizon, range-based readiness framing, and plain-language risk explanation.]
