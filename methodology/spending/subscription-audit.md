# Subscription Audit

> This is a scenario file that builds on the [Day-to-Day Spending overview](spending-overview.md). See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This scenario covers reviewing recurring subscriptions and memberships to identify waste, consolidate overlapping services, and reallocate spending toward priorities.

**Required data points:**
- List of known recurring charges (apps, streaming, gym, software, memberships)
- Rough monthly total of all subscriptions
- Which subscriptions the user actively uses vs. forgot about
- Whether any subscriptions are shared with others (family plans, split costs)
- What the user would rather spend that money on (savings goal, experience, debt)

**Recommended data points:**
- Bank/credit card statement availability for a full subscription inventory
- Annual vs. monthly billing (some subscriptions hide in annual charges)
- Free alternatives the user is already aware of
- Subscriptions tied to work or tax-deductible categories
- Emotional attachment to specific services (comfort spending)

**Conversation guidance:**
- Start with a quick inventory — most people undercount subscriptions by 30-50%.
- Distinguish between "forgot I had it" (easy cut) and "use it but could downgrade" (optimization).
- Frame savings as annual totals — $15/month feels small, $180/year feels actionable.
- Don't push to cut things the user genuinely values — help them cut what they don't.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Subscriptions masking compulsive purchasing behavior
- Total recurring charges consuming a disproportionate share of discretionary income
- Discovery of unauthorized charges or fraud indicators
