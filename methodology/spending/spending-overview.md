# Day-to-Day Spending Decisions

> This is the category overview for Day-to-Day Spending. See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers budgeting, monthly spending pressure, savings-rate decisions, and trade-offs between current lifestyle and future goals.

**Required data points:**
- Monthly take-home income (household if shared finances)
- Monthly fixed costs (housing, debt minimums, insurance, childcare)
- Monthly variable/discretionary spending (best estimate is fine)
- Current savings amount or savings rate
- Primary concern (overspending, guilt, uncertainty, conflicting goals)

**Recommended data points:**
- 3-6 month trend in spending categories
- Emergency fund level (in months of core expenses)
- Upcoming known expenses in next 12 months
- Automations already set up (auto-save, auto-invest, sinking funds)
- Behavioral pattern (impulse spending, irregular income, partner friction)

**Conversation guidance:**
- Accept rough estimates — precision is not required to start.
- Ask for one month baseline first before optimizing categories.
- Suggest low-friction changes before aggressive cuts.
- Tie recommendations to user priorities (security, flexibility, enjoyment).

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Inability to cover essential bills (housing, food, utilities)
- Repeated overdrafts/late fees with no buffer
- High-interest revolving debt growing month-over-month

**Example exchange:**

> **User**: I bring home about $4,800/month and I feel like I'm spending everything. How do I figure out where it's all going?

> **AI**: [PLACEHOLDER — replace with real AI response demonstrating: normalizing rough numbers, asking for fixed vs. variable split, offering 1-2 low-friction changes, and tying back to what the user actually wants from their money.]
