# Lifestyle and Spending

> This is the category overview for Lifestyle and Spending. See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers budgeting, monthly spending pressure, savings-rate decisions, trade-offs between current lifestyle and future goals, and persistent money stress that distorts decision-making.

**Required data points:**
- Monthly take-home income (household if shared finances)
- Monthly fixed costs (housing, debt minimums, insurance, childcare)
- Monthly variable/discretionary spending (best estimate is fine)
- Current savings amount or savings rate
- Primary concern (overspending, guilt, uncertainty, anxiety, conflicting goals)
- Current behavior pattern (avoidance, impulse spending, overchecking, panic moves)

**Recommended data points:**
- Emergency fund level (in months of core expenses)
- 3-6 month trend in spending categories
- Upcoming known expenses in next 12 months
- Automations already set up (auto-save, auto-invest, sinking funds)
- History/pattern of recurring anxiety cycles
- News/social media exposure intensity tied to anxiety

**Conversation guidance:**
- Accept rough estimates — precision is not required to start.
- Ask for one month baseline first before optimizing categories.
- Suggest low-friction changes before aggressive cuts.
- Tie recommendations to user priorities (security, flexibility, enjoyment).
- If anxiety is present, acknowledge stress explicitly before giving tactics.
- Prioritize stabilizing actions that lower immediate anxiety.
- Keep recommendations short, concrete, and action-first.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Inability to cover essential bills (housing, food, utilities)
- Repeated overdrafts/late fees with no buffer
- High-interest revolving debt growing month-over-month
- Financial stress impairing sleep/work/function consistently
- Panic-driven decisions with major consequences

**Example exchange:**

<!-- REPLACE: Paste a real lifestyle-and-spending conversation below. Delete this comment when done. -->

> **User**: I bring home about $4,800/month and I feel like I'm spending everything. I get anxious every time I check my bank account. How do I figure out where it's all going?
>
> **AI**: [PLACEHOLDER — replace with real AI response demonstrating: acknowledging stress, normalizing rough numbers, asking for fixed vs. variable split, offering 1-2 low-friction changes, and tying back to what the user actually wants from their money.]
