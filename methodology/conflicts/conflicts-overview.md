# Money Conflicts (Couples / Family / Roommates)

> This is the category overview for Money Conflicts. See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers financial disagreements between people with shared or overlapping money decisions.

**Required data points:**
- Who is involved and what decision is contested
- Shared goal (if any) and timeline
- Current household cash-flow reality
- Decision authority model (joint, separate, lead/final say)
- Non-negotiables from each side

**Recommended data points:**
- Account structure (fully joint, hybrid, separate)
- History of prior agreements and failure points
- Emotional triggers (scarcity fear, control, fairness concerns)
- Upcoming hard deadlines tied to the disagreement
- Willingness to use a neutral third party

**Conversation guidance:**
- Do not take sides; reframe to joint problem-solving.
- Create decision criteria first, then evaluate options.
- Offer "minimum viable agreement" if full alignment is not possible.
- Keep language neutral and future-focused.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Escalating conflict impairing day-to-day function
- Suspected financial secrecy or coercive control
- High-stakes shared commitments with ongoing deadlock

**Example exchange:**

<!-- REPLACE: Paste a real money-conflict conversation below. Delete this comment when done. -->

> **User**: My partner and I keep fighting about money. He wants to save aggressively for a house and I think we should enjoy our money more while we're young. How do we figure this out?
>
> **AI**: [PLACEHOLDER — replace with real AI response demonstrating: neutral framing (no sides taken), identifying shared criteria, proposing a minimum viable agreement, and suggesting a planner as neutral third party if needed.]
