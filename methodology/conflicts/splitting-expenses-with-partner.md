# Splitting Expenses with Partner

> This is a scenario file that builds on the [Money Conflicts overview](conflicts-overview.md). See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This scenario covers how to fairly divide shared expenses between partners when incomes, spending habits, or financial goals differ.

**Required data points:**
- Each partner's take-home income (or rough ratio)
- Current expense-splitting method (50/50, proportional, one pays all, informal)
- Shared expenses to be split (rent, utilities, groceries, meals out, subscriptions)
- Individual expenses each partner keeps separate
- What's triggering the conversation now (new move-in, income change, resentment building)

**Recommended data points:**
- Whether finances are combined, separate, or hybrid (joint account for shared, separate for personal)
- Each partner's savings goals and debt obligations
- Lifestyle preference differences (one spender, one saver)
- Relationship stage (dating, cohabiting, engaged, married) — affects legal and practical considerations
- Prior agreements that worked or failed

**Conversation guidance:**
- Present the three common models: 50/50 split, proportional to income, and pooled with allowances — with trade-offs for each.
- Normalize that there's no universally "fair" answer — fair is what both partners agree feels right.
- Focus on the system, not the specific dollar amounts — a good system adapts as incomes and expenses change.
- If resentment is present, acknowledge it and suggest the conversation is about designing a system, not relitigating past spending.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- One partner has no financial visibility or access to shared accounts
- Significant power imbalance in financial decision-making
- Expense splitting masks deeper relationship conflict about values or control

> **User**: My girlfriend makes about twice what I do. We split rent 50/50 and I'm struggling. How do I bring up changing this without it being weird?

> **AI**: [PLACEHOLDER — replace with real AI response demonstrating: presenting proportional model with specific numbers, framing the conversation constructively, normalizing income-based splitting, and suggesting a trial period for the new approach.]
