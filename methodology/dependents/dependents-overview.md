# Supporting Dependents Financially

> This is the category overview for Supporting Dependents. See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers supporting children, parents, partner, or others while balancing household stability, boundaries, and long-term goals.

**Required data points:**
- Who is financially dependent and for what amount/frequency
- Whether support is temporary or open-ended
- Household monthly surplus/deficit before support
- Priority obligations that cannot be compromised
- Decision objective (continue, reduce, structure, or stop support)

**Recommended data points:**
- Existing agreements/expectations with dependents
- Shared contributions from siblings/other family members
- Education/caregiving timelines
- Own retirement savings status while providing support
- Emotional/cultural constraints around support decisions

**Conversation guidance:**
- Validate values first; then build sustainable limits.
- Frame support as a plan (amount, duration, checkpoints), not a vague promise.
- Show trade-offs explicitly between helping now and future security.
- Help the user think through how to communicate boundaries when relevant.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Support obligations are forcing debt growth or missed essentials
- Care decisions involve legal/benefits complexity
- Conflict among family contributors with unclear responsibilities

**Example exchange:**

<!-- REPLACE: Paste a real dependents conversation below. Delete this comment when done. -->

> **User**: I've been sending my mom $800/month but it's killing my ability to save. I feel guilty even thinking about stopping. What should I do?

> **AI**: [PLACEHOLDER — replace with real AI response demonstrating: validating values before numbers, framing support as a structured plan, showing trade-offs between current help and own future security, and offering boundary-setting language.]
