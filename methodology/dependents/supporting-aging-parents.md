# Supporting Aging Parents

> This is a scenario file that builds on the [Supporting Dependents overview](dependents-overview.md). See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This scenario covers providing financial support to elderly parents, including navigating care costs, coordinating with siblings, leveraging benefit programs, and protecting your own financial stability while helping.

**Required data points:**
- Parent(s) current income sources (Social Security, pension, savings, other)
- Parent(s) monthly expenses and specific gaps you're covering
- Your current monthly support amount and how long it's been ongoing
- Whether siblings or other family members contribute (and how much)
- Parent(s) health status and anticipated care trajectory

**Recommended data points:**
- Parent(s) eligibility for benefit programs (Medicaid, VA benefits, SNAP, local assistance)
- Housing situation and whether changes are being considered (downsizing, moving in)
- Long-term care insurance status
- Legal documents in place (power of attorney, healthcare proxy, will)
- Your own retirement savings trajectory while providing support

**Conversation guidance:**
- Map the full picture: parent's resources + family contributions + benefit programs — before assuming the user must cover the gap alone.
- Explore benefit programs early — many families leave significant assistance on the table.
- Frame sibling coordination as a practical conversation, not a guilt exercise.
- Show the user their own retirement impact explicitly — helping parents shouldn't be invisible to long-term planning.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Parent needs skilled nursing or memory care (costs $5k-$10k+/month)
- Medicaid planning or spend-down strategies needed
- Family conflict over care responsibilities or financial contributions
- Parent has significant assets but poor liquidity (e.g., house-rich, cash-poor)
