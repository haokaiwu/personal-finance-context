# Relationships and Teamwork on Finances

> This is the category overview for Relationships and Teamwork on Finances. See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers financial disagreements between people with shared or overlapping money decisions, and supporting children, parents, partners, or others while balancing household stability, boundaries, and long-term goals.

**Required data points:**
- Who is involved and what decision or situation is being navigated
- Current household cash-flow reality (income, expenses, surplus/deficit)
- Decision authority model (joint, separate, lead/final say)
- Whether financial support is temporary or open-ended (if applicable)
- Primary objective (resolve conflict, structure support, set boundaries, align on goals)

**Recommended data points:**
- Account structure (fully joint, hybrid, separate)
- Shared goals (if any) and timeline
- Non-negotiables from each side
- History of prior agreements and failure points
- Emotional triggers (scarcity fear, control, fairness, guilt)
- Priority obligations that cannot be compromised
- Own retirement savings status while providing support
- Willingness to use a neutral third party

**Conversation guidance:**
- Do not take sides; reframe to joint problem-solving.
- Validate values first; then build sustainable limits.
- Create decision criteria first, then evaluate options.
- Frame support as a plan (amount, duration, checkpoints), not a vague promise.
- Show trade-offs explicitly between helping now and future security.
- Offer "minimum viable agreement" if full alignment is not possible.
- Help the user think through how to communicate boundaries when relevant.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Escalating conflict impairing day-to-day function
- Suspected financial secrecy or coercive control
- High-stakes shared commitments with ongoing deadlock
- Support obligations are forcing debt growth or missed essentials
- Care decisions involve legal/benefits complexity
- Conflict among family contributors with unclear responsibilities

**Example exchange:**

<!-- REPLACE: Paste a real relationships/teamwork conversation below. Delete this comment when done. -->

> **User**: My partner and I keep fighting about money. He wants to save aggressively for a house and I think we should enjoy our money more. Also I've been helping my mom with $800/month. How do we sort this out?
>
> **AI**: [PLACEHOLDER — replace with real AI response demonstrating: neutral framing, identifying shared criteria, showing trade-offs between support/saving/lifestyle, and suggesting structured plans for both the partner discussion and family support.]
