# Career Decisions

> This is the category overview for Career Decisions. See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers income trajectory and work-choice decisions with financial implications (job changes, promotions, relocation, sabbaticals, upskilling, and role trade-offs).

**Required data points:**
- Current total compensation (or best estimate)
- New/alternative compensation package (if comparing options)
- Geography / cost-of-living context when location changes
- Time horizon (short-term cash need vs. long-term career upside)
- Major constraints (visa, family obligations, health, schedule, burnout)

**Recommended data points:**
- Benefits details (health plan cost, 401k match, HSA/FSA, PTO)
- Equity details (grant size, vesting, liquidity assumptions)
- Commute / childcare / relocation costs
- Current savings rate and monthly fixed expenses
- Career optionality value (brand, skill-building, manager quality)

**Conversation guidance:**
- Compare full outcomes, not just salary.
- Gather side-by-side numbers (current vs. alternative).
- If the user is deciding fast, provide a quick decision framework first, then refine.
- Explicitly separate **money outcome** from **career trajectory** and **quality of life**.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Complex equity/tax situations (ISOs, NSOs, RSUs, 83(b), multi-state taxes)
- International relocation with tax treaty/residency implications
- Leaving employment to start a business with unclear runway

**Example exchange:**

> **User**: I got offered a new job at $115k but I'd have to move from Dallas to Denver. I'm making $98k now. Is it worth it?
>
> **AI**: [PLACEHOLDER — replace with real AI response demonstrating: COL comparison, full-comp comparison, separation of money vs. career vs. lifestyle, and natural follow-up questions per the conversation guidance above.]
