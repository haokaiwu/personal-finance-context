# Changing Jobs

> This is a scenario file that builds on the [Career Decisions overview](career-overview.md). See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This scenario covers evaluating a specific job switch — comparing offers, assessing transition costs, and weighing career trajectory trade-offs when the user has a concrete alternative in hand.

**Required data points:**
- Current vs. new total compensation (base, bonus, equity)
- Start date and any gap between roles
- Transition costs (relocation, signing bonus clawback, unvested equity forfeited)
- Benefits comparison (health plan, 401k match, PTO)
- Notice period and any non-compete/garden leave constraints

**Recommended data points:**
- Signing bonus or relocation package details
- Probation/at-will terms at new role
- Cultural or role-scope differences that affect longevity
- Impact on partner/family logistics
- Career narrative coherence (how this move reads on a resume)

**Conversation guidance:**
- Build a side-by-side comparison: current total comp vs. new total comp including transition costs.
- Amortize one-time costs (relocation, equity forfeiture) over the first 1-2 years to show true net gain.
- Flag "hidden costs" the user may not have considered: COBRA gap, 401k rollover timing, vesting cliff reset.
- If the user is emotionally decided, shift to "how to make this transition cleanly" rather than relitigating the choice.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Equity situations requiring tax elections (83(b), ISO exercise timing)
- Non-compete or clawback clauses with ambiguous enforceability
- International move with tax residency implications

**Example exchange:**

> **User**: I have an offer for $130k at a startup but I'd be leaving $40k in unvested RSUs at my current company. How do I think about this?
