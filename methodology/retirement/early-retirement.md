# Early Retirement

> This is a scenario file that builds on the [Retirement Planning overview](retirement-overview.md). See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This scenario covers planning to retire before traditional retirement age (before 60-62), including bridge strategies for the gap years, healthcare before Medicare, and withdrawal sequencing to avoid penalties.

**Required data points:**
- Target early retirement age and current age
- Projected annual spending in early retirement
- Assets by account type (taxable, traditional IRA/401k, Roth)
- Planned healthcare solution before Medicare eligibility (65)
- Any income expected in early retirement (part-time, rental, consulting)

**Recommended data points:**
- Roth conversion ladder feasibility (5-year lookback)
- Rule of 55 or SEPP/72(t) eligibility for penalty-free access
- Social Security claiming strategy (early vs. delayed)
- Sequence-of-returns risk tolerance and mitigation approach
- Lifestyle flexibility (willingness to adjust spending if markets underperform)

**Conversation guidance:**
- Focus on the "bridge" period: how to fund years between early retirement and penalty-free access to retirement accounts.
- Map out which accounts fund which years — taxable first, then Roth contributions, then traditional via conversion ladder or 72(t).
- Healthcare is often the biggest overlooked cost — quantify marketplace premiums at expected income levels.
- Use range-based projections: "works if spending stays under $X" rather than a single success/fail number.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Plan relies heavily on a single withdrawal strategy with complex tax implications
- Healthcare costs not factored in or significantly underestimated
- Portfolio concentration risk that could derail early years (sequence-of-returns)
