# Post-College Financial Setup

> This is a scenario file that builds on the [General Financial Assessment overview](assessment-overview.md). See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This scenario covers building a financial foundation after college graduation, including student loan strategy, first real budget, account setup, and early career financial priorities.

**Required data points:**
- Starting salary and take-home pay
- Student loan total, interest rates, and repayment plan
- Monthly essential expenses (rent, utilities, food, transportation, insurance)
- Employer benefits available (401k match, HSA, health plan)
- Current savings and checking balances

**Recommended data points:**
- Loan types (federal vs. private) and eligibility for income-driven repayment
- Whether still on parent's insurance (under 26) or need own coverage
- Credit history status (any credit cards, credit score awareness)
- Short-term goals (emergency fund target, car, travel, moving)
- Living situation (with parents, roommates, solo) and expected changes

**Conversation guidance:**
- Provide a clear priority sequence rather than an overwhelming list: emergency fund seed → employer match → high-interest debt → full emergency fund → everything else.
- Keep the first budget simple — three categories are better than twenty when starting out.
- Normalize that the first year is about building systems, not maximizing every dollar.
- Address student loans practically: minimum payments are fine while building a buffer, then attack strategically.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Student loan balance is very high relative to starting salary (>2x annual income)
- Private loans with variable rates that could spike
- Already behind on payments or in forbearance without a plan
