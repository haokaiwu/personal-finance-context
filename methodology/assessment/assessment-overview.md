# General Status Check

> This is the category overview for General Status Check. See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers broad status checks, financial prioritization, and second-opinion requests when no single narrow topic dominates.

**Required data points:**
- Income (household where relevant)
- Core monthly expenses and debt minimums
- Savings rate / monthly surplus
- Liquid emergency buffer
- Top 1-3 goals with rough timeline

**Recommended data points:**
- Net worth components (rough asset/liability categories)
- Retirement contribution level and employer match status
- High-interest debt details
- Major upcoming life events (12-24 months)
- Current system quality (automations, account sprawl, complexity)

**Conversation guidance:**
- Start with triage order: stabilize, protect, optimize, then accelerate.
- Give a short prioritized plan (first 30 days, next quarter, next year).
- Avoid perfectionism; focus on highest-impact moves first.
- Reconfirm goals before deep optimization advice.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Multiple high-risk issues at once (cash-flow instability + high-interest debt + no buffer)
- User cannot meet essentials without new borrowing
- Material uncertainty in reported numbers preventing safe personalization

**Example exchange:**

<!-- REPLACE: Paste a real general-assessment conversation below. Delete this comment when done. -->

> **User**: I make about $75k, have some student loans, a little in savings, and no real plan. Can you just tell me what I should be doing with my money?
>
> **AI**: [PLACEHOLDER — replace with real AI response demonstrating: triage ordering (stabilize → protect → optimize → accelerate), asking for 2-3 key numbers to prioritize, and giving a short first-30-days action list rather than a comprehensive overhaul.]
