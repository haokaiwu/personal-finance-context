# Buying a Car

> This is a scenario file that builds on the [Major Purchases overview](purchases-overview.md). See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This scenario covers vehicle purchase decisions including new vs. used trade-offs, financing structures, and total cost of ownership analysis.

**Required data points:**
- New vs. used preference and target price range
- Down payment amount available
- Credit score range (for rate estimation)
- Current vehicle status (trade-in value, lease end, no car currently)
- Intended use and expected annual mileage

**Recommended data points:**
- Pre-approval status or dealer financing offers
- Insurance cost difference between options
- Maintenance/warranty considerations (CPO, extended warranty)
- How long the user plans to keep the vehicle
- Whether the car is needed for income (commute, gig work, business use)

**Conversation guidance:**
- Frame the decision as total monthly cost: payment + insurance + fuel + maintenance — not just sticker price.
- Compare 3-year and 5-year total cost of ownership for leading options.
- If the user is stretching budget, explore whether a lower price point meets their actual needs.
- Separate emotional preference (want) from functional requirement (need) without being dismissive of either.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Financing terms above market rates suggesting credit issues worth addressing first
- Loan term extending well beyond the useful life of the vehicle
- Purchase would create negative equity on top of existing auto debt

**Example exchange:**
