# Market Downturn Panic

> This is a scenario file that builds on the [Money Anxiety overview](anxiety-overview.md). See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This scenario covers managing fear and impulsive financial decisions during market drops, recessions, or periods of economic uncertainty.

**Required data points:**
- What specific market event is triggering the anxiety
- Portfolio size and rough allocation (stocks/bonds/cash)
- Time horizon for invested funds (retirement date, goal date)
- Whether the user has already made changes (sold, moved to cash, stopped contributing)
- Current income stability (is the market drop also threatening their job?)

**Recommended data points:**
- Portfolio check frequency (daily, weekly, rarely)
- News/social media consumption related to markets
- Past behavior during downturns (2020, 2022) and how it worked out
- Whether contributions are automated or manual
- Cash reserves outside investment accounts

**Conversation guidance:**
- Acknowledge the fear first — "It makes sense that you're worried" — before any data or logic.
- Separate portfolio risk from income risk: a market drop with stable income is fundamentally different from a market drop during job uncertainty.
- Use historical context gently, not dismissively: "Markets have recovered from every downturn, but that doesn't make this one feel less scary."
- Offer concrete behavioral guardrails: check portfolio no more than once per week, don't make changes within 48 hours of feeling panicked, automate contributions to remove emotion from the equation.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- User has already panic-sold significant portions and needs a recovery plan
- Anxiety is affecting sleep, work, or relationships beyond normal stress
- Portfolio is concentrated in a way that makes the downturn disproportionately impactful
