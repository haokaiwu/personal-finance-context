# Job Loss

> This is a scenario file that builds on the [Unexpected Life Events overview](life-events-overview.md). See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This scenario covers navigating sudden unemployment including immediate cash management, benefits continuity, and financial planning during a job search.

**Required data points:**
- Severance details (amount, duration, conditions)
- Unemployment insurance eligibility and estimated benefit
- Health insurance status (COBRA availability, marketplace options, partner's plan)
- Current monthly essential expenses (housing, utilities, food, debt minimums)
- Cash reserves and how many months of runway that provides

**Recommended data points:**
- Outstanding PTO/vacation payout expected
- 401k loan balance (if any — repayment may accelerate)
- Non-compete or garden leave restrictions affecting job search timeline
- Partner/household income that partially covers expenses
- Estimated job search timeline based on industry and role level

**Conversation guidance:**
- Lead with stabilization: "You're safe for X months" framing based on their runway.
- Prioritize actions by urgency: benefits enrollment deadlines (COBRA is 60 days), unemployment filing, expense reduction.
- Separate immediate actions (this week) from near-term planning (this month) from strategic moves (next quarter).
- Avoid catastrophizing — provide a calm, structured action list even if the situation is tight.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Runway is less than 1 month of essential expenses
- Severance agreement contains complex legal terms requiring review
- Job loss triggers potential default on secured debt (mortgage, car loan)
