# Liquidity and Life Events

> This is the category overview for Liquidity and Life Events. See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers significant planned spending (car, wedding, home, major milestones) and sudden financial shocks or windfalls (job loss, medical bills, divorce, inheritance) where timing, financing, and triage materially affect outcomes.

**Required data points:**
- What happened or what they're planning, and decision deadline
- Total expected cost and timing (for planned events) or immediate financial impact (for unexpected events)
- Current liquid cash and emergency fund balance
- Monthly burn rate and essential obligations due in next 30-90 days
- Income continuity risk (stable, uncertain, interrupted)

**Recommended data points:**
- Payment plan or financing details (cash, financing, mixed; interest rate/term)
- Whether planned spending is replacement vs. additive
- Opportunity cost (what goal gets delayed)
- Maintenance/ownership costs (insurance, upkeep, fees, taxes)
- Access to emergency credit or family support
- One-time vs. ongoing cost profile
- Immediate tax implications (if known)
- Emotional capacity for complexity right now

**Conversation guidance:**
- Start with affordability and resilience before optimization.
- For planned events: use simple scenario framing — buy now, delay, or downscope.
- For unexpected events: prioritize stabilization first, optimization second.
- Give a short step sequence when relevant: next 48 hours, next 30 days, next 90 days.
- Keep choices simple and reversible where possible.
- Use calm, directive language and avoid overloading options.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Purchase would reduce emergency fund below ~3 months
- Debt-to-income would likely exceed prudent ranges after purchase
- Financing terms are unclear or unusually expensive
- Imminent eviction/foreclosure/utility shutoff risk
- Bankruptcy discussions or legal liability concerns
- Large inheritance or settlement with unclear tax/legal treatment
