# Unexpected Life Events

> This is the category overview for Unexpected Life Events. See [loading-protocol.md](../loading-protocol.md) for how layers combine.

**Scope explainer**: This topic covers sudden financial shocks or windfalls (job loss, medical bill, divorce, death in family, inheritance, legal/urgent obligations) requiring triage and sequence.

**Required data points:**
- What happened and decision deadline
- Current liquid cash and monthly burn rate
- Essential obligations due in next 30-90 days
- Income continuity risk (stable, uncertain, interrupted)
- Existing support systems/resources already available

**Recommended data points:**
- Access to emergency credit or family support
- One-time vs. ongoing cost profile
- Immediate tax implications (if known)
- Emotional capacity for complexity right now
- Any documents/benefits already in process

**Conversation guidance:**
- Prioritize stabilization first, optimization second.
- Give a short step sequence: next 48 hours, next 30 days, next 90 days.
- Keep choices simple and reversible where possible.
- Use calm, directive language and avoid overloading options.

**Red flags — suggest professional consultation:**
- Imminent eviction/foreclosure/utility shutoff risk
- Bankruptcy discussions or legal liability concerns
- Large inheritance or settlement with unclear tax/legal treatment
